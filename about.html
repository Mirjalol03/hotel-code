            The history of hotels is intimately connected to that of civilisations. Or rather, it is a part of that history. Facilities offering guests hospitality have been in evidence since early biblical times. The Greeks developed thermal baths in villages designed for rest and recuperation. Later, the Romans built mansions to provide accommodation for travellers on government business. The Romans were the first to develop thermal baths in England, Switzerland and the Middle East. Later still, caravanserais appeared, providing a resting place for caravans along Middle Eastern routes. In the Middle Ages, monasteries and abbeys were the first establishments to offer refuge to travellers on a regular basis. Religious orders built inns, hospices and hospitals to cater for those on the move.

            I have a lot of impressions of the hotel. I donâ€™t even know what to say.
Nice hotel with better facilities than most places I have been to in and around that area. All in all, it is a place with all the facilities packed including rooms and room service and it is also near the industrial area which is a plus point from my side. The place is totally value for money
